Below is brief of references identified in the search:\n\nUS20100066750A1 (Tier 1) discloses a method to augment the real world scene with â€œvirtual graffitiâ€. When user watches live video (i.e. receiving a captured image), location of the user device is sent to the server. Server determines the messages i.e. â€œvirtual graffitiâ€ available near the location sent by the mobile device, then these messages i.e. â€œvirtual graffitiâ€ are received by the user device. These messages include â€œimage of the graffiti's surroundings along with the graffitiâ€ (i.e. Tag) and the surrounding image can be considered as patches. User device also process the physical location (i.e. a location that is near a location specified by the determined location information) of the received messages i.e. â€œvirtual graffitiâ€. User device then compares the userâ€™s surroundings with the graffiti's surroundings (i.e. template matching process), if found appropriate, the virtual graffiti will be embedded in or merged with the user's view of the real-world.\n\nUS9953438B2 (Tier 2) relates to a method of providing annotation of the images\/video toward an object of interest automatically, where the image is captured\/acquired by portable image capturing device. The portable device comprises of sensors for identifying position\/location and orientation information of the portable device near the scene. It has mentioned that, as the portable device is having enough power so, all the object information is downloaded by the portable device from the server\/database, where the object annotation task is performed. The server also consists of referenced objects corresponding to geographic position and their corresponding desired annotation (it can be seen from fig. 3). Further, it has mentioned that, the acquired image is compared with the set of 2D references images which are stored in the server\/database (as shown in fig. 3).\nSince, the captured object of the image is compared with the reference object after downloading the object information at the portable device, there is no explicit information about â€œthe second location information that specifies a second location that is based on a first location specified by the received first location informationâ€.\n\nUS20070268392A1 (Tier 2) relates to a method of providing additional information of a target image captured by portable digital camera based on the positional\/location information of the digital camera or target image\/scene. A digital camera comprises of compass, a sensor defining the altitude and a GPS positioning device for capturing the location and orientation information of the target image and device. The location information is transmitted over a transmission network to the server\/database and in response to the location information, camera device receives the second information corresponding to the location information of the target image. Further, the received second additional information (for e.g. Text, image link etc.) is merged with target image on the display of the portable digital camera.\n\nHowever, there is no explicit information about the image\/template matching process, mentioned in this reference.\n\n\nRegards,\nRitu Tyagi ","time":"2019-10-08 05:15:00","source":"file"},
